title: Hello World!

Hello World! As per the traditions of computer programming this blog post is a sanity check to see if I have configured the entire thing properly.

### The Origin of Hello World
Brian Kernighan is widely credited for putting the words 'hello' and 'world' together. The following code can be found in his book - A Tutorial Introduction to the Programming Language B, published in 1973. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
```
main( ) {
  extrn a, b, c;
  putchar(a); putchar(b); putchar(c); putchar('!*n');
}
a 'hell';
b 'o, w';
c 'orld';
```

And the rest, as they say, is history. Cheers!

My name is Tushar Aggarwal. I have recently graduated from Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani - Hyderabad with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I am not really good with words, but the purpose of this blog is to share interesting developments and observations in the fields of technology and music.

My research interests lie primarily in the area of networking and cyber security. I am also a self taught guitarist trying to understand the mathematical nature of music theory. I have an eclectic taste in music but I generally follow alternative rock, blues, indie and post rock genres of music.

See you around!
